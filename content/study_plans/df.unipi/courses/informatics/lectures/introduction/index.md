# Introduction to informatics

::: note
In this course, we are not interested in formalism, technical details and history of computer, this is a very *"hands-on"* course. If you want to know morea about computers there are a lots of entertaining ways of knowing more:
 - search on the internet, especially wikipedia
 - visit computer museums, such as the [UniPi](https://www.msc.sma.unipi.it/) one
 - take some more advanced courses, even online if you want
 - read old books
 - destroy your computer and see what's inside

## What is a computer

A [**computer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) is, well, just a *computer*, a *calculator* that is very good at *arithmetics*!  
Actually, it is not just a *calculator* like the average pocket calculators, because we call a computer an (usually electronic) device that can be programmed to "carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically" (i.e. [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) or, more generally, [programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program)). 

Informatics is strictly related to mathematics, it born from math thanks to some very clever mathematicians that needed more than pencil and paper, for example [Alan Turing](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), probably the most famous one!  
In some math courses, for example in the [Analysis](/study_plans/df.unipi/courses/analisi/) you might find some theorems that implies some iterative procedures that very well adapts to computers. You may also notice some very basic concepts such as [formal systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system) and [GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) that show how well formal systems and algorithms are related to plain numbers!

### The computer architecture

Now, we need to give an idea of how a computer is made, i.e. its [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture).  
We wil take a look at the basic [von Neumann architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture), firstly described on his [draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Draft_of_a_Report_on_the_EDVAC)
